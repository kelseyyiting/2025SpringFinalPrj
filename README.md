# Analysis of Bicycle Accident Patterns in Chicago

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and data for analyzing bicycle crashes in Chicago, comparing privately owned bicycles and Divvy rental bikes (classic vs. electric). Key aims:
- Assess crash frequency and severity by vehicle type
- Investigate the effect of rider age and time of day on injury outcomes
- Visualize spatial hotspots for owned vs. rental crashes
- Perform regression to test the relationship between rider age and no-injury rates
